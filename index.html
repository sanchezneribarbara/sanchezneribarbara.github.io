Special interests in human health and diseases; genetics and plant nutrition. Masters in Computational Biology from Carnegie Mellon University and Entomology from Purdue University.</span></p><p><span>Research experience in Machine Learning and Genetics. Programming skills in Python, SAS and R.</span></p><p><span>I am a life-long-learner. Ideally, I want to improve human health, or help feed the world.</span></p><p><span>I am excited to reboot my career after an absence of working in my field due to a prolonged health challenge. For several years, I have used my bilingual skills, as a part time interpreter accompanying clients to a variety of appointments: including chemotherapy, obstetrics, and medical visits at the children’s hospital. This work experience has enhanced my communication skills particularly improving my ability to explain complex ideas in to people that are in stressful situations.</span></p><p><span>As I prepared to return to my field, I obtained my SAS certification in June 2020 and online statistics certificate from Texas A &amp; M University. Seeking an organization that would welcome my work ethic and curiosity. Open to “returnship” opportunities as I restart my field specific career.</span></p><ul>
